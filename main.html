                <p>Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance (MMSA) launched ACRES, a hands-on STEM professional development series as a blended experience—part in-person, part online—that was piloted in Maine. We worked with them to move it to a fully online PD for afterschool practitioners across the country. Then, we helped MMSA develop a structure for training and supporting the ACRES Coaches virtually. </p>

                <p>A team is a group of people who work together toward a common goal. Teams have defined membership (which can be either large or small) and a set of activities to take part in. People on a team collaborate on sets of related tasks that are required to achieve an objective. Each member is responsible for contributing to the team, but the group as a whole is responsible for the team’s success.</p>
